# Python-ml-classifier
This project implements a medical image classifier using TensorFlow in Python, designed to distinguish between real and synthetic brain MRI scans. The goal is to evaluate and improve the reliability of synthetic data generation techniques by training a neural network to detect subtle differences between real and artificially generated images.
In addition, the project integrates Explainable AI (XAI) techniques through Grad-CAM heatmaps, allowing visual interpretation of the modelâ€™s decisions. These visualizations help highlight the specific regions of the brain MRIs that the model focuses on during classification, providing insight into model behaviour and supporting trust and transparency in medical AI applications.
