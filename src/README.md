## üìÅ Project Structure

The project is divided into **four main Python files**, each handling a specific task:

- **`Trainer.py`**  
  Responsible for **creating and training** the classification model using TensorFlow. After training, the model is saved locally for future use.

- **`Classifier.py`**  
  Loads the pre-trained model and uses it to **perform predictions** on new MRI images, distinguishing between real and synthetic data.

- **`HeatMap.py`**  
  Generates **Grad-CAM heatmaps** to provide interpretability for the classifier's predictions. This helps identify the areas of the image that influenced the model's decision.

- **`Gui.py`**  
  Implements a simple **graphical user interface** using **Cluede Sonet**. The GUI allows users to interact with the classifier, visualize predictions, and view XAI heatmaps. It integrates functionalities from all the other modules.

- **`Dataset Availability`**

  Due to size and licensing restrictions, the full dataset used for training and evaluation is not included in this repository.
However, the repo contains two sample MRI images for each class (real and synthetic), which can be used for quick testing and demonstration purposes.
If you need access to the full dataset or want to replicate the training process, please contact the repository owner.
